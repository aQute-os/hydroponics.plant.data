# Tomato

## Overview
Tomatoes are one of the most popular crops for hydroponic cultivation. They thrive in controlled environments and can produce year-round with proper care. Hydroponic tomatoes often have superior flavor and can be grown without soil-borne diseases.

## Varieties
**Recommended for Hydroponics:**
- Cherry tomatoes (Sweet 100, Sun Gold)
- Beefsteak (Big Beef, Cherokee Purple)
- Roma/Paste (San Marzano)
- Cluster tomatoes (Campari)

**Best for Tower Systems:**
- Determinate varieties for compact growth
- Cherry and grape tomatoes for continuous production

## Growth Characteristics
- Growth rate: Fast (fruits in 70-90 days from seed)
- Size at maturity: 4-8 feet tall (indeterminate), 3-4 feet (determinate)
- Root system: Extensive, requires good oxygen levels in nutrient solution
- Temperature preference: 65-85°F (18-29°C)

## Harvest
- Time to harvest: 70-90 days from seed, 50-60 days from transplant
- Harvesting method: Pick when fully colored but still firm
- Yield: 10-30 lbs per plant depending on variety and growing conditions
- Continuous harvest possible with indeterminate varieties

## Common Issues
**Pests:**
- Whiteflies
- Aphids
- Spider mites

**Diseases:**
- Blossom end rot (calcium deficiency)
- Powdery mildew
- Fusarium wilt (less common in hydroponics)

**Prevention:**
- Maintain consistent EC and pH levels
- Ensure adequate calcium in nutrient solution
- Provide good air circulation
- Monitor temperature and humidity

## Tips for Success
- Start with quality seeds or seedlings
- Prune lower leaves to improve air circulation
- Support plants with stakes or trellises
- Remove suckers on indeterminate varieties to focus energy on fruit production
- Shake plants gently during flowering to aid pollination
- Maintain consistent environmental conditions
- Keep EC slightly lower during fruit ripening for better flavor
- Ensure adequate spacing to prevent disease spread

## Nutrient Notes
- Tomatoes are heavy feeders
- Increase potassium during fruiting stage
- Monitor calcium levels to prevent blossom end rot
- Maintain magnesium for leaf health
