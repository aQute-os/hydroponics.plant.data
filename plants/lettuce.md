# Lettuce

## Overview
Lettuce is one of the easiest and most rewarding crops for hydroponic systems, especially tower setups. It grows quickly, requires minimal space, and is perfect for beginners. Most varieties can be harvested in 30-45 days, making it ideal for continuous production.

## Varieties
**Best for Hydroponics:**
- Butterhead (Buttercrunch, Bibb)
- Loose-leaf (Red Sails, Oak Leaf, Salad Bowl)
- Romaine (Little Gem, Parris Island Cos)
- Batavian/Summer Crisp (Nevada)

**Best for Tower Systems:**
- Loose-leaf varieties for continuous harvest
- Butterhead for compact growth
- Mini romaine varieties

## Growth Characteristics
- Growth rate: Very fast (harvest in 30-45 days)
- Size at maturity: 6-12 inches diameter
- Root system: Shallow, compact
- Temperature preference: 60-70°F (15-21°C)

## Harvest
- Time to harvest: 30-45 days from seed
- Harvesting method: 
  - Cut and come again: Harvest outer leaves
  - Whole head: Cut at base when mature
- Yield: Multiple harvests from same plant with proper technique
- Best harvested in morning when leaves are crisp

## Common Issues
**Pests:**
- Aphids
- Thrips
- Slugs (less common in hydroponics)

**Diseases:**
- Tip burn (calcium deficiency or environmental stress)
- Root rot (poor oxygenation)
- Downy mildew

**Environmental Issues:**
- Bolting (premature flowering) from heat stress
- Bitter taste from high temperatures
- Leggy growth from insufficient light

**Prevention:**
- Keep temperature below 75°F
- Maintain consistent moisture
- Ensure proper air circulation
- Monitor EC levels - lettuce is sensitive to high salinity

## Tips for Success
- Grow multiple varieties for diverse salad mixes
- Plant in succession (every 2 weeks) for continuous harvest
- Keep water temperature cool (60-68°F ideal)
- Use lower light intensity than fruiting crops
- Harvest in morning for best quality
- Don't let lettuce bolt - harvest promptly
- Red and purple varieties tolerate heat better
- Provide adequate spacing for air circulation

## Nutrient Notes
- Lettuce prefers lower EC than most crops
- High nitrogen for leafy growth
- Ensure adequate calcium to prevent tip burn
- Keep nutrient solution cool
- Change solution regularly to prevent buildup
