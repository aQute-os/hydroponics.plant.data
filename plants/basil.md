# Basil

## Overview
Basil is one of the most popular and rewarding herbs for hydroponic cultivation. It grows quickly, produces abundantly, and thrives in controlled environments. Hydroponic basil often has more intense flavor and aroma compared to soil-grown plants. It's an excellent choice for year-round production in tower systems.

## Varieties
**Best for Hydroponics:**
- Sweet Basil (Genovese) - Classic Italian basil
- Thai Basil - Anise-scented, purple stems
- Lemon Basil - Citrus aroma
- Purple Basil (Dark Opal) - Ornamental and flavorful
- Greek Basil - Compact, small-leaved variety

**Best for Tower Systems:**
- Greek Basil - Compact growth habit
- Genovese - High yield, excellent flavor
- Lemon Basil - Unique flavor profile

## Growth Characteristics
- Growth rate: Fast (harvest in 28-35 days from seed)
- Size at maturity: 12-24 inches tall
- Root system: Moderate, develops quickly
- Temperature preference: 65-80째F (18-27째C)

## Harvest
- Time to harvest: 28-35 days from seed for first harvest
- Harvesting method: 
  - Cut stems above leaf nodes
  - Never remove more than 1/3 of plant at once
  - Pinch flowering buds to promote leaf growth
- Yield: Continuous harvest possible for 4-6 months
- Best harvested in morning for peak flavor

## Common Issues
**Pests:**
- Aphids
- Whiteflies
- Japanese beetles (less common indoors)

**Diseases:**
- Fusarium wilt
- Downy mildew (in humid conditions)
- Root rot (from overwatering or poor oxygenation)

**Environmental Issues:**
- Leggy growth from insufficient light
- Leaf yellowing from nutrient deficiency
- Bolting from temperature stress or photoperiod

**Prevention:**
- Maintain proper temperature (avoid cold drafts)
- Ensure adequate light intensity
- Provide good air circulation
- Keep EC in optimal range
- Prevent flowering by regular pinching

## Tips for Success
- Pinch growing tips regularly to encourage bushy growth
- Remove flower buds immediately to maintain leaf production
- Harvest frequently to promote new growth
- Maintain warm temperatures - basil is sensitive to cold
- Provide high light intensity for compact, flavorful plants
- Keep water temperature between 65-75째F
- Start seeds in succession for continuous supply
- Prune regularly to prevent woody stems
- Group with other high-light plants in tower system

## Nutrient Notes
- Basil is a moderate feeder
- Nitrogen important for leafy growth
- Avoid excessive nitrogen which can reduce flavor
- Potassium enhances flavor and oil production
- Monitor for calcium deficiency (leaf tip burn)
- Maintain consistent EC for best flavor

## Flavor Optimization
- Higher light intensity increases essential oil content
- Slightly lower EC (1.4-1.6) can enhance flavor
- Harvest before flowering for best taste
- Morning harvest captures peak essential oils
- Slight stress (careful pH management) can concentrate flavors
